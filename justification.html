		<h3>Home page</h3>
				<br>
		<p>Once people click on our page, at the very top of the screen there is a navigation bar. This navbar is used to guide the visitors easily through our page, as they can click each heading to go to the page of their choice. The navbar has our brand’s logo on the left side and on the right side there is a search bar where visitors can search for specific topics. 
On the homepage we have a wireframe for a carousel on which we have inserted some pictures of our retreat. The carousel is meant to give our guests a better view of what the retreat looks like and what activities will be done. We placed a carousel on the top of our page, because it is an eyecatcher. 
Once you scroll down there is a pink jumbotron. We used jumbotrons to divide the page into different sections, each section giving a small insight into our brand. The first jumbotron used is to describe our brand’s vision, values and what our brand really stands for. In the jumbotron we also describe the main problem, which follows with our next wireframe, which is a picture and a piece of text.
The text describes what our solution is to the problem, and what our retreat can offer. The picture is a smiling woman to show our site visitors that we can provide what they need. In addition, in the text we have created a hyperlink which leads to the ‘’Retreat page’’ where visitors can find all the information about our retreats. 
Next, there is another jumbotron with the title ‘’The women behind Bliss’’. This jumbotron is followed by 4 wireframes of 4 pictures of our team. Underneath our pictures are small texts which describe us and the reason why we started this brand. This is meant to create a more personal relationship with the people that view our site, in order to give them a better idea of who we are. 
At the end of our page we have a footer, which is similar to the navbar. The footer consists of a pink jumbotron (same colour as the navbar) and ‘’©Bliss Experience’’ text written on the right side.

				<h3>Retreats page</h3>
				<br>
				
				<p>Just like on the Home page, the first thing people will see is the navbar where they can pick one of the pages to see what each page contains. The logo is on the left side of the navbar and the search bar is on the right side. 
Underneath the navbar is a piece of text titled as ‘’About our retreats’’. In this area we explain the retreats we offer in more detail and provide enough information for the visitors to get a good idea of what activities are offered. Next to the text there is a wireframe of a carousel with pictures of the retreat itself. The carousel is an easy way for people to view many pictures without having to scroll through a whole gallery page. 
Next up, there is another wireframe of a map. This map is installed in order to show the site’s visitors where our retreat lies on a map. They can zoom in and out of the map as well to get a clearer view if needed. 
Right next to the map is another wireframe of the retreat prices. This is useful information for the visitors. Underneath the prices we provide a button which will lead to the ‘’Book a retreat’’ page, which is the page on which people can book a retreat of their choice and pay the amount. 
Last but not least, right next to the prices wireframe we provide a wireframe of a picture. This picture is an example of what the planning is for the retreats. It states what they will be doing from the morning till night time. 
At the end of the page there is the same footer as mentioned previously, with the pink jumbotron and the text.

		<p>In order to keep the theme of the Brand Road Map we decided to use the same colours for our logo and backgrounds. The colours used for the website are black, white, and pink. The reason why we chose the colours pink and white, is because they are bright colours, therefore they have a feminine touch that they bring to the website, which is meant to attract more women. We used the colour black for emphasis, so for example, to emphasize letters in the logo (Bliss) and to emphasize the buttons in order for people to notice them more easily.</p>
